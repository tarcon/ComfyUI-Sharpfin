ComfyUI node to use advanced Torchvision transforms built for accuracy, visual quality, and speed.

## Quickstart

2. Install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)

# Features

- Confer to the documentation of the underlying library [Sharpfin](https://github.com/drhead/Sharpfin)

## Develop

To install the dev dependencies and pre-commit (will run the ruff hook), do:

```bash
cd sharpfin

The `-e` flag above will result in a "live" install, in the sense that any changes you make to your node extension will
automatically be picked up the next time you run ComfyUI.

node.
